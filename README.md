# C-P2-UNI-FRI-2023
The C Language programming course known as "Programming 2" at the [University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Computer and Information Science](https://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en)

Professor [Dr. Boštjan Slivnik](https://www.fri.uni-lj.si/sl/o-fakulteti/osebje/bostjan-slivnik "Boštjan Slivnik")

All the code is in C.

This course is known as the hardest course out of the ten courses in the first year at the Faculty, with a passrate of around 35% every year, meaning 65% of students fail the class each Academic year.
