# C-P2-UNI-FRI-2023
The C Language programming course known as "Programming 2" at the [University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Computer and Information Science](https://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en)

Professor [Dr. Boštjan Slivnik](https://www.fri.uni-lj.si/sl/o-fakulteti/osebje/bostjan-slivnik "Boštjan Slivnik")

All the code is in C.

This course is known as the hardest course out of the ten courses in the first year at the Faculty, with a passrate of around 35% every year, meaning 65% of students fail the class each Academic year.

## Programming 2 - Progress tracker

```sh
Control Constructs I - Week 1 
```
- [x] Sum modulo: Write a program that reads numbers a and b and outputs their sum modulo 10
- [x] All equal: Write a program that reads a number n and n more numbers, and then outputs 1 if all of the n numbers are equal to each other, and 0 if this is not the case.
- [x] Second largest: Write a program that reads a number n and n more numbers, and then outputs the second largest among those n numbers. If there are multiple numbers that are the largest, the second largest number is equal to the largest number.
